## documentation for business card

Greetings! I had used html and css to code and style my website. I also had used Adobe Illustrator and google fonts. I created all of my vector art in Illustrator and converted them to svgs for my website.

This whole project was honestly a major accomplishment for me! I had never coded anything in my life before until now and it was a super cool experience. I kinda wish I had started with a fully blank slate because I feel as though I was lost at some points when trying to edit or add things but over all I got it done! The buttons were probably the hardest thing for me to tackle, still not exact but I'm happy with them and my website over all :) .
